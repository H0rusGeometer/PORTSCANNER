# Port Scanner

This is a simple port scanner written in Python. The script takes an IP address as a command line argument and scans for open ports on that IP address.
Getting Started
Prerequisites

    Python 3.x

Installation

    Clone the repository:

bash

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/port-scanner.git

    Navigate to the project directory:

bash

cd port-scanner

    Make the portscan shell script executable:

bash

chmod +x portscan

Usage

To run the port scanner, simply call the portscan shell script from the command line with the IP address you want to scan as the argument:

bash

./portscan 'ip address'

Replace 'ip address' with the actual IP address you want to scan.

The script will scan the IP address for open ports and print out any open ports it finds.
